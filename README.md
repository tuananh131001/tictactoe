## Introduction
Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (Commonwealth English), or Xs and Os (Irish English) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players. [1]
## Motivation
When I was studied in elementary , my childhood is stick with tic-tac-toe .A game that you can play everywhere just with a pen and a piece of paper,you can compete with your friends and have a great momemnt when winning.You don't have to teach the other because the game is very easy to play.So this time I make it on the phone with multiplayer mode so you can play with your friend even from very far distance or if you dont have friend you can also play with an AI with different mode to experience.
